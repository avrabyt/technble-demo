## Live Master Class - Demo app 

Preditcs player's playing position - Minimalistic app build on trained model with [k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn). 

```yaml
Charlie Jackson:
- K-Nearest Neighbors is a clustering algorithm used to classify new data based upon its 'closeness' to other laballed data points. 
- As it uses labeled data to make predictions on new data, it is a supervised learning technique. 
- The features for k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm must be continous rather than categorical.
```

For example, clustering based on centroids position, figure below self-explains the idea behind, (*however, not from the current example tried here*)
